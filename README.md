# WTF_sub-algorithm 

This script is for "Estimating divergent forest carbon stocks and sinks via a knife set approach" - based on a wandering through the random forest (WTF) sub-algorithm. 10 Fold Cross Validation contained the R codes and raw data for operating and cross validation. 

To conquer the highly divergent and irregular estimation of carbon stocks and sinks (CSSs) of tall-statured Phyllostachys edulis (Carri√®re) J. Houz. forests, this study designed a knife set (KS) approach that did not change the weights of variables and combined linear regression (LR) and wandering through a random forest (WTF) sub-algorithm approach. 

The main reason is that any design change in the weight of the independent variable always results in overfitting when the effect of the unobserved variable on the target variable is greater than that unless the number of variables exceeds the interpolation threshold. Previous studies have roughly assessed CSS using linear regression models or even climate classification tables. However, these kinds of approaches were relatively ineffective, especially when CSS data contained high divergence, because many unobserved variables affected target variables we were unaware of. 

Furthermore, this study has another implication: we emphasise that a simple method is not necessarily inferior and may sometimes be more efficient than a complicated method. In other parts of target variables that are difficult to estimate (such as chaotic variables), complicated computing methods are used to address them, such as operating different cooking methods for different ingredients and finally combining a fabulous set meal.

## Communication / collaboration with Forest Utilisation Lab at Kyoto University
While not required, we encourage researchers planning to use the knife set approach to contact the principal investigator (Prof. Masako DANNOURA, Kyoto University) to inform her of intended use of the data and to discuss potential collaboration.
