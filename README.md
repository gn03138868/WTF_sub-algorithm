# WTF_sub-algorithm 
#This script is for "Estimating divergent forest carbon stocks and sinks via a simple hybrid algorithm" based on a part of simple hybrid algorithm (SHA) - wandering through the random forest (WTF) sub-algorithm. 
Figues and Tables contained the flowchart of the SHA and the results estemated by the SHA.
10 Fold Cross Validation contained the R codes and raw data for operating and cross validation. #
